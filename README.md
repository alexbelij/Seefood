A UNIQUE iOS RECIPE APP

Seafood allows users to take pictures of ingredients they have to get recipe ideas. The app recognizes which foods are present in the images, and outputs recipes which use those identified ingredients. 

The motivation of this app is to give users ideas as to what they can make with leftover ingredients they have, or if they want to know what they can make with a certain food.
